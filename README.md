# product-os

An AI harness for product work. Skills, context, and output — structured so Claude Code can operate as a capable thought partner, not just a code assistant.

Fork it. Replace the placeholders. Start working with an AI that knows your product, your team, and how you think.

## What this is

Most people use Claude as a chat window. Ask a question, get an answer, move on. The context resets every session. The AI never accumulates knowledge of your product, your org, or your voice.

This system is different. It's a workspace — a structured set of files that Claude reads before every session. Skills tell Claude how to do specific types of work. Context files tell it what's true right now. Output lands in organized docs that compound over time.

The result: an AI that operates like a senior colleague, not a search engine. It knows your OKRs, your positioning, your team dynamics, your writing style. It can draft a strategy doc, run competitive research, prep for a board meeting, or track user relationships — and do each one consistently, the way you'd want it done.

## How it works

```
You                Claude Code              Workspace
───                ───────────              ─────────
/brief          →  reads brief skill    →   context/ (OKRs, narratives, cadences)
                   runs data sources    →   cache/ (scan outputs)
                   writes output        →   docs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md

/prd            →  reads prd skill      →   context/ (product context)
                   reads existing PRDs  →   docs/product/
                   writes new PRD       →   docs/product/prd-feature.md

/strategy       →  reads strategy skill →   context/ + docs/market-research/
                   synthesizes          →   docs/strategy/strategy-topic.md
```

Claude Code is the execution layer. The workspace is the memory. Skills are the interface.

## Skills

Skills are markdown files. Each one defines a complete process — what to read, how to think, what to produce. Invoke them with `/skill-name` in Claude Code, or reference them in conversation.

**Writing & strategy**
- `/strategy` — executive-grade strategy docs with structured frameworks
- `/prd` — PRDs, briefs, checklists, decision logs
- `/narrative` — positioning and messaging docs
- `/essay` — expressive, well-reasoned essays with a six-doctrine arc system
- `/shape` — take a fuzzy idea and give it form before committing to a PRD

**Research & intelligence**
- `/competitive-analysis` — deep dives on competitors, extract learnings
- `/market-research` — landscape scans, market sizing, segment research
- `/ux` — UX audits, competitive benchmarks, funnel analysis

**Operations**
- `/brief` — daily morning brief or weekly review (cross-references all data sources)
- `/status` — workstream tracking across projects, dependencies, blockers
- `/meeting-notes` — scan email, fetch transcripts, extract decisions and commitments
- `/tasks` — organize todos, surface urgent work
- `/roadmap` — product roadmap management
- `/feedback` — collect, triage, and prioritize feedback
- `/users` — user relationship tracking and follow-ups
- `/comms` — leadership updates, investor comms

**Social & content**
- `/xgrow` — daily X/Twitter content engine
- `/lgrow` — weekly LinkedIn content engine
- `/xarticle` — long-form X articles
- `/reply` — voice-matched replies for any channel
- `/harvest` — extract experience bank entries from sessions

## How to fork

1. Fork this repo
2. Open `CLAUDE.md` and replace all `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` with your context
3. Fill in `context/current-context.md` with what's true right now
4. Add your OKRs to `context/okr-status.md`
5. Install [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
6. Run `/brief` to see it work

That's it. The system starts working immediately. It compounds as you add more context and produce more output.

## What it's not

This isn't an automation or an agent that runs on a schedule. It's a harness — Claude does the work when you ask, in the way you've defined, with the context you've provided. You stay in control of every decision. The AI does the research, drafting, synthesis, and tracking.

## The future

[Alloy](https://github.com/namankumar/alloy) is the GUI and web layer for this system — a collaborative workspace where skills, context, and output are accessible from a browser, shareable with teammates, and editable without a terminal. product-os is the foundation. Alloy is where it goes next.
